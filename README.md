# Weather-Station

**** A WORK IN PROGRESS ****


A raspberry pi weather station using Python and sensors.

Something I have been playing around with, eventually I will have the raspberry pi powered over Ethernet and out in my back yard. I will have all of the sensors and webcam uploads to Weather underground.com.
